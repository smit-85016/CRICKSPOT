"Box Cricket Ground Booking"

Cricket is one of the most popular sports in India, and 
box cricket has gained massive popularity in urban areas 
due to limited space for full-sized grounds. However,

unstructured, and inefficient. Many people face issues

Lack of a centralized pla orm to view available 
grounds. 
Inconvenience in booking and payment processes 
(many s ll rely on phone calls or offline payments). 
Unclear cancella on policies leading to disputes 
and financial losses. 
This project aims to develop a web-based pla orm 
where users can seamlessly book a box cricket ground in 
their city, select me slots, make online/offline 
payments, and sort grounds based on city, price, and 
name. Addi onally, a structured cancella on policy (15
minute cutoff) ensures fairness for both players and 
venue owners. 
Problem Statement: 
Despite the growing demand for box cricket, booking a 
ground remains a me-consuming and unorganized 
process. Users face difficulty in finding available 
grounds, comparing prices, making payments, and 
understanding cancella on policies. Venue owners also 
struggle to manage bookings efficiently. This project 
aims to develop a user-friendly, efficient, and secure 
online pla orm to streamline the booking process, 
enhance accessibility, and provide a seamless 
experience for both users and ground owners.
